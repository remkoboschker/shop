Modelling app structure through the routes works well for an Ember app, we'll see if it holds for Angular

First I do a sketchy model to orient and write down ideas, then I switch to working through features and implementing them, after setting up the basic infrastructure.

Choose to separate actions into separate urls to make command query concerns clear. Also it leads to an obvious interactions flow for small screens.

I did not manage to get Yadda or Cucumber to work with Protractor. Got close, but time was too short.
